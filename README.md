# slack-copy-bot

@copybot is a bot that copies messages from one Slack channel to another. It's very simple. Here's what it does.

Let's say I'm in #general and I say
```That was super #random @copybot```
Because I referenced @copybot, he'll copy my message to #random. And he'll also mark it as having come from #general.

This is what he'll say in the #random channel:
```#general: That was super #random```

That's it!
